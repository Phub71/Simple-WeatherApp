This is a very simple project done for the Chalmers Teknologkonsulter AB and it only serves for educational purposes. 
The webapp intends to fetch and display information regarding the weather description of a city to the user. The API used in this project is from www.openweathermap.org . 


Please note: 
- For running the website on your local computer, you can open one of the html files with your browser. 
- This is the first version of the website and might get updated as time goes by.
- Feel free to modify the project for your educational purposes.
